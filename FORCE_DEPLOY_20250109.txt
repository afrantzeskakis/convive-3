CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FORCE FILE
==============================

Created: July 9, 2025 9:36 PM UTC

ISSUE: Production server is running outdated code
- Database is correctly configured (email is nullable)
- Test scripts confirm user creation with null email works
- But web interface still shows constraint error
- This indicates cached/old code is running

PURPOSE: Force Railway to rebuild and redeploy the application

VERIFIED:
- Database allows null emails (tested via script)
- Local code has proper null email handling
- Production server needs fresh deployment

This file forces a new deployment to sync code with database state.
