# Complete Database Sync Guide

## Issues Found & Fixed
1. **Email field constraint** - Production requires email (NOT NULL) while code allows optional
2. **Missing table** - call_recordings table missing in production

## Local Database Status
âœ… All issues fixed locally:
- Email field is now nullable
- call_recordings table created
- All constraints properly aligned

## Production Sync Steps

### 1. Deploy Code Changes
```bash
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

### 2. Complete Production Database Sync (REQUIRED)
After deployment completes:

1. Open Railway dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click "Generate Shell Command" 
5. Run the command in your terminal
6. Once connected, run:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/complete-production-sync.ts
```

This single command will:
- Make email field nullable
- Create call_recordings table
- Verify all fixes applied

### 3. Verify Everything Works
- Create a user without email in SuperAdmin dashboard
- Test login with the new user (like restadmin1)
- All features should work properly

## Summary
This sync will resolve ALL current database mismatches between local and production. After running the complete sync script, your databases will be fully aligned.
