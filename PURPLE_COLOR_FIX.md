# Purple Color Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The purple colors were not displaying correctly in production due to:
1. Hardcoded white/black color overrides in critical CSS
2. Missing explicit purple color definitions for Tailwind classes
3. CSS variables not being properly utilized

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Color Overrides
- Changed hardcoded `white` and `#020817` to use CSS variables
- Preserved theme colors in dropdown menus and dialogs
- Maintained proper color inheritance from CSS variables

### 2. Added Explicit Purple Definitions
```css
.bg-primary {
  background-color: hsl(262 83% 58%) !important;
}

.text-primary {
  color: hsl(262 83% 58%) !important;
}

.border-primary {
  border-color: hsl(262 83% 58%) !important;
}
```

### 3. Fixed Component Variants
- Button primary variants now properly show purple
- Badge primary variants display correct purple background
- Hover states maintain purple with proper opacity (90%)

## CSS File Details
- **Size**: 111KB (increased from 109KB)
- **Purple HSL**: `hsl(262 83% 58%)` = #8B5CF6
- **Instances**: Multiple explicit purple color definitions added

## Deployment
The CSS has been rebuilt and is ready for deployment. Run:
```bash
./deploy-css-fix.sh
```

This will deploy the updated CSS with all purple color fixes to production.
