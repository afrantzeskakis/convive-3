# Web to Mobile App Conversion Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for converting the Convive web application into a polished iOS app for the Apple App Store.

## Architectural Approach

We've chosen a **React Native with Expo** approach for several key reasons:

1. **Code Sharing**: Leverages existing React/TypeScript skills and allows code sharing between web and mobile platforms
2. **Rapid Development**: Faster path to market with a "learn once, write anywhere" approach
3. **Near-Native Performance**: Provides excellent performance for our use case
4. **Simplified Deployment**: Expo simplifies the build and deployment process

## Project Structure

The mobile app mirrors the web app's architecture with mobile-specific adaptations:

```
mobile-app/
├── assets/                 # App icons, splash screens, and static assets
├── src/
│   ├── api/                # API services that connect to our backend
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components 
│   ├── context/            # React context providers (auth, theme, etc.)
│   ├── features/           # Feature-specific implementation details
│   ├── screens/            # Main app screens
│   └── utils/              # Helper functions and utilities
├── App.tsx                 # Main app component and navigation setup
├── app.json                # Expo configuration
└── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Files Explanation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.tsx` | Main entry point, sets up navigation and global providers |
| `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Manages user authentication state |
| `src/api/services.ts` | Connects to backend API endpoints |
| `src/screens/*` | Individual app screens |
| `app.json` | Expo configuration including app metadata |

## Web-to-Mobile Component Mapping

| Web Component | Mobile Equivalent | Adaptation Required |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| HTML elements | React Native components | Replace with platform components (View, Text, etc.) |
| CSS/Tailwind | StyleSheet objects | Convert to React Native's styling system |
| React Router | React Navigation | Replace routing with navigation stack |
| localStorage | SecureStore | Replace with native secure storage |
| Fetch/Axios | Same, with mobile considerations | Add offline support, connection handling |

## Authentication Flow Adjustments

The mobile app uses a similar authentication flow to the web app but with these changes:

1. Tokens stored in SecureStore instead of localStorage
2. Added "Sign in with Apple" support (required by App Store)
3. Support for biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
4. Persistent sessions with auto-renewal

## API Integration

Backend API integration strategy:

1. The mobile app connects to the same backend API as the web app
2. API requests include device-specific information
3. Push notification endpoints are mobile-only
4. Added request/response compression for mobile data efficiency
5. Implemented token refresh mechanism for long-running sessions

## Mobile-Specific Features

These features are unique to the mobile app:

1. **Push Notifications**: For upcoming events, messages, and restaurant promotions
2. **Offline Mode**: Caching of essential data for offline access
3. **Mobile Payments**: Native integration with Apple Pay
4. **Device Permissions**: Camera access for menu scanning, location for restaurant proximity
5. **Quick Reference Mode**: Special UI for restaurant staff to discreetly access menu information

## Apple App Store Requirements

Key considerations for App Store submission:

1. Privacy policy and data usage transparency
2. App Store screenshots and preview videos
3. In-app purchase integration for subscriptions
4. "Sign in with Apple" implementation
5. Content moderation systems
6. Age rating considerations (17+ due to social features)

## Testing Strategy

The mobile app requires testing across:

1. Multiple iOS versions (iOS 14+)
2. Various device sizes (iPhone and iPad)
3. Network conditions (fast, slow, offline)
4. Integration with backend services
5. Apple-specific features (In-App Purchase, Sign in with Apple)

## Development Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Weeks 1-2 | Core app structure, navigation, and authentication |
| 2 | Weeks 3-4 | Restaurant browsing, profiles, and meetup scheduling |
| 3 | Weeks 5-6 | Chat functionality and restaurant menu analysis |
| 4 | Weeks 7-8 | Payment processing and subscription management |
| 5 | Week 9 | Performance optimization and testing |
| 6 | Week 10 | App Store preparation and submission |

## Future Enhancements

After initial release, planned enhancements include:

1. Android version development
2. Advanced matchmaking algorithms
3. AR menu visualization
4. Restaurant host training modules
5. Expanded offline capabilities
