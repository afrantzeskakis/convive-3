EXISTING AUTHENTIC CONTENT (PRESERVE AND ELABORATE):

ENHANCEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preserve all authentic data exactly as provided
2. Use theoretical framework ONLY to elaborate and add nuance
3. Expand existing content with sensory detail and professional depth
4. Maintain consistency with the verified rating and characteristics
5. Add educational value through detailed explanations

Create enhanced versions that expand each section to 140-190 words while maintaining the authentic foundation. Use the theoretical framework for sensory development, structural analysis, and educational depth.
