# Deployment Troubleshooting for AI-Assisted Development

This guide helps you fix common deployment issues when you don't know how to code. Written in simple language with copy-paste solutions.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Build Failed" Error

**What it means:** Your app couldn't compile for production

**Solutions to try:**
```bash
# Copy these exact commands to AI:
"The build is failing on [platform name]. Here's the error: [paste error]. Please help me fix this."

# Common fixes:
- Missing environment variables
- Wrong Node version (should be 20)
- Missing dependencies
```

### 2. "Database Connection Failed"

**What it means:** Your app can't connect to the database

**Quick fix:**
1. Check if DATABASE_URL is set in platform settings
2. Make sure it starts with `postgresql://` 
3. Add `?sslmode=require` at the end if missing

**Copy this to AI:**
```
"My database won't connect on [platform]. The DATABASE_URL is set but I get this error: [paste error]"
```

### 3. "Application Error" or Crashes

**What it means:** Your app starts but then crashes

**Check these:**
- All environment variables are set (OPENAI_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, etc.)
- Logs show the actual error (check platform's log viewer)

**Tell AI:**
```
"My app deploys but crashes immediately. Here are the logs: [paste logs]. What's wrong?"
```

## Platform-Specific Help

### Railway
**Where to find help:**
1. Dashboard → Your Project → Logs (see what's wrong)
2. Dashboard → Variables (check environment variables)
3. Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway (very helpful community)

**Common Railway issues:**
- Build fails: Usually missing environment variable
- App crashes: Check logs, often it's DATABASE_URL format

### Render
**Where to find help:**
1. Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
2. Dashboard → Environment (for variables)
3. Render Community: https://community.render.com

**Common Render issues:**
- Slow deploys: Normal on free tier
- Database issues: Make sure to wait for database to be ready

### Vercel
**Where to find help:**
1. Project → Functions → Logs
2. Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Vercel Support (very responsive)

**Common Vercel issues:**
- API routes not working: Need to configure properly
- CORS errors: Frontend/backend on different domains

## Getting AI Help

### When asking AI for help, always provide:

1. **Platform name** - "I'm deploying on Railway"
2. **Exact error** - Copy/paste the full error message
3. **What you tried** - "I set the DATABASE_URL but it still fails"
4. **Logs** - Always include the deployment logs

### Good AI prompts for deployment:

```
"I'm deploying on [platform] and getting this error: [paste error]. 
Here are my logs: [paste logs]. 
I've already set these environment variables: [list them].
How do I fix this?"
```

```
"My Railway deployment fails at the build step with this error: [error].
I'm using the config files you created. What's wrong?"
```

```
"The app works on Replit but crashes on Render. 
The logs show: [paste logs]. 
All my environment variables are set. Help!"
```

## Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure ALL of these are set on your deployment platform:

- [ ] DATABASE_URL - Your PostgreSQL connection
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY - For AI features  
- [ ] SESSION_SECRET - Any random string
- [ ] NODE_ENV - Set to "production"
- [ ] APIFY_API_TOKEN - If using wine verification

## Simpler Alternatives

### If deployment is too complex:

1. **Replit Deployments** (when it works)
   - Simplest option
   - Just click deploy in Replit
   - No configuration needed

2. **Glitch.com**
   - Import from GitHub
   - Very beginner-friendly
   - Good for testing

3. **Hired Help**
   - Fiverr: Search "deploy Node.js app"
   - Upwork: "Deploy Express React app"
   - Usually $50-100 for setup

## Emergency Fixes

### If nothing works:

1. **Go back to Replit**
   ```
   "I can't get deployment working. Let's focus on making the app better on Replit for now."
   ```

2. **Try simpler platform**
   ```
   "Railway isn't working. Can you help me deploy to Glitch instead? It seems simpler."
   ```

3. **Get human help**
   - Railway Discord
   - Render Community  
   - Stack Overflow (tag: deployment)

## Debugging Checklist

Before asking for help, check:

1. **Logs** - What's the actual error?
2. **Environment Variables** - All set correctly?
3. **Build Command** - Is it `npm run build`?
4. **Start Command** - Is it `npm start`?
5. **Node Version** - Is it 20?
6. **Database** - Is it connected?

## Common Success Patterns

Apps that deploy successfully usually:
- Have all environment variables set
- Use standard commands (npm start)
- Have simple dependencies
- Include health check endpoint
- Have proper error handling

## What to Tell AI When Stuck

```
"I've been trying to deploy for [time] and keep getting [error].
I've tried [what you tried].
Can you either:
1. Give me a different solution
2. Suggest a simpler deployment platform
3. Help me understand what's actually wrong"
```

Remember: Many developers struggle with deployment. You're not alone, and it's okay to need help!
