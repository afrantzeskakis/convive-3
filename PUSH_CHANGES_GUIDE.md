# Push Changes to Railway

Your changes haven't deployed because they need to be pushed to GitHub first. Railway only deploys what's in your GitHub repository.

## Quick Push Command

Run these commands to push your changes:

```bash
# Add the modified files
git add client/src/pages/TableAccess.tsx

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix Table Access mobile formatting - responsive buttons and text sizes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## What Changed

The Table Access page now has:
- ✅ Mobile-responsive toggle buttons (stack vertically on mobile)
- ✅ Smaller text sizes on mobile screens (text-2xl → text-3xl)
- ✅ Full-width buttons and cards on mobile
- ✅ Improved spacing and padding (px-4 on mobile, px-6 on desktop)
- ✅ Convive Select card adapts to mobile screens

## After Pushing

1. Railway will automatically detect the push
2. Check your Railway dashboard - deployment should start within 30 seconds
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Your mobile formatting fixes will be live!

## Alternative: Use the Script

I've created a script that does all this for you:

```bash
./push-changes.sh
```

This will commit and push all the mobile formatting changes automatically.
